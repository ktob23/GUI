I learned that GitHub is a place that hosts Git, where you can push and pull code. GitHub is a place where you can interact with others in your community, allowing you to collaborate on your projects and other open-source projects. Also, you can create branches or fork the repository to freely experiment with the original code before committing changes. You can also use pull requests to discuss changes in the code before they are implemented.
